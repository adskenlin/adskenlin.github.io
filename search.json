[{"title":"How to Create Personal Blog on github Using Hexo","url":"/2021/07/28/personal_blogs/","content":"\n## Dependencies\n+ Node.js\n+ npm\n+ Git\n\n\n## Install Hexo\nif you don't have `node.js` and npm `npm` on your workstation, please visit [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install the node.js. (npm would be automatically installed if node.js installation is done)\nTo check whether node.js and npm are successfully installed:\n```bash\n# in cmd/terminal\nnode -v # v14.17.3 or others\nnpm -v # 6.14.13 or others\n``` \nIf you are using win10 as your operate system and get errors with these codes, you should re-open the powershell/cmd as administor after the installation then try the codes above.\n\nThen:\n```bash\nnpm install -g hexo-cli\n```\nTo check whether hexo successfully installed:\n```bash\nhexo -v\n```\nYou'll see the version information e.g.:\n```bash\n hexo-cli:4.3.0, \n node:14.17.3, \n ... \n```\n\n## Create Blogs\nFirst of all, you have to navigate to the the folder, where you plan to create your blogs' folder.\n```bash\ncd E:\\\nmkdir my_blogs\ncd my_blogs\n```\nThen run:\n```bash\n# if you are using powershell as administor on windows,\nhexo init\n# if you are on mac/linux, \nsudo hexo init\n```\nCreate your first post:\n```bash\nhexo new \"My First Post\"\n```\nA new file with .md format will be created in `source/_posts/`. You could directly edit it in file. Also, you could preview your blog on your local machine with:\n```bash\n#establish a localhost for blog\nhexo server\n\n# if you have some updates to your blogs, use\nhexo clean\nhexo generate\nhexo server\n```\nThe response will show you a addresse like `http://localhost:4000`, you could visit it on local.\n\n\n## Deploy Blogs\nAfter you know how to write and make changes to your blogs on local, we'll introduce how to create a github page and deploy your blog to it. Install Deloyer with:\n```bash\nnpm install -save hexo-deployer-git\n``` \nGo to your github and create a new repositery called `username.github.io`. `username` should be your github username. This will be used as the address of github page later.\n\nOn your local, you need to edit the `_config.yml`. You could find this file in the blog folder. `_config.yml` is the key to set up your blogs, such as set up the name, discription, theme and so on. \n```bash\n# in _config.yml, find the part #Deployment change the info like below\ndeploy:\n  type: 'git'\n  repo: your-repo-adress\n  branch: master\n```\nAfter this, in your command line type:\n```bash\nhexo deploy\n```\nAfter a while, you would be able to visit `username.github.io` to see your own blog.\n\n## Change the Theme of Your Blog\nThere are varous free themes on [Hexo's official site](https://hexo.io/themes/). You could pick one to visit its github repo and follow the instruction to install it.\n\nE.g. I'd like to change the theme of my blog, firstly, \n```bash\n# in the path of your blog folder, clone the theme to local\ngit clone `url_of_the_theme_repo` themes/my_theme\n```\nThen modify the `_config.yml`. (most theme repos have demo, you could directly compare the `_config.yml` to your own and make some changes)\n\nAfter this:\n```bash\nhexo clean\nhexo generate\n# take a preview on local, \nhexo server\n# if everything is fine,\nhexo deploy\n```\n\n\n\nyou've successfully created your own blog!
